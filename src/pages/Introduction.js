          You don’t have to “master” every skill you ever learn. I believe that
          developing new skills in a way that allows you to perform *well enough
          for your own purposes* is – by far – the most common and valuable
          purpose of skill acquisition. Based on my research, reaching that
          level doesn’t take anywhere close to 10,000 hours – you can usually
          achieve the goals you set yourself in around 20 hours of deliberate
          practice.

        It is possible to learn to play an instrument in a day if only the day
        had enough hours to allow you to practice playing it for the number of
        times it would take your brain to recall patterns easily.
