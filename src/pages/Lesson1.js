        Many people see the keys on a piano as different pieces of a puzzle when
        they are, in fact, building blocks. Arrange them in whatever order you
        choose to create a sound that is pleasing to you.

      <div className="activity">
        <p>
          What is the significant difference between a puzzle and a set of
          building blocks?
        </p>
        <img src={Question} alt="activity" />
      </div>
      <div className="tip">
        <img src={Tick} alt="tip" />
        <p>
          A puzzle requires the exact initial form of an idea, like a picture,
          to be recreated, while building blocks allow you to form and bring new
          ideas to life.
